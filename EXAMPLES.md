# Portable Desk adapters

These commands run on Bun without the personal `ical` or `email` CLIs. Install dependencies with `bun install`. The [Desk tutorial](https://github.com/the-metafactory/cortex/blob/main/docs/desk/getting-started.md) shows how to configure sources.

## Read an ICS calendar

```sh
bun bin/desk-ics.ts examples/calendar.ics --days 7
bun bin/desk-ics.ts https://calendar.example.org/calendar.ics --days 7
```

`desk-ics <file-or-https-url> [--days 7]` prints an `events` list for today and the following days. `--days` accepts 1–60. Floating times use the host's time zone. UTC times and IANA `TZID` values are supported. URL requests use HTTPS with a 20-second timeout.

The reader handles unfolded properties, escaped text, date-only events, `DTEND`, `EXDATE`, and daily or weekly recurrence with `INTERVAL`, `COUNT`, `UNTIL`, and plain weekday `BYDAY` values. Weeks start on Monday. It skips unsupported recurrence rules, explicit `WKST`, `RDATE`, and `DURATION` rather than guessing, and reports the skipped count on stderr. Recurrence scanning is bounded to 200 years from its starting point. Overrides with `RECURRENCE-ID` are ignored, so calendars using changed or cancelled individual occurrences need a fuller adapter. This example does not implement all of iCalendar.

The bundled calendar repeats "Plan the day" each day and "Team sync" on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. No account or permission grant is needed. `examples/mail.json` is a static mail source for the same tutorial:

```yaml
mc:
  desk:
    sources:
      - id: calendar
        command: [/absolute/path/to/bun, /absolute/path/to/cortex-desk-adapters/bin/desk-ics.ts, /absolute/path/to/cortex-desk-adapters/examples/calendar.ics]
      - id: sample-mail
        command: [/bin/cat, /absolute/path/to/cortex-desk-adapters/examples/mail.json]
```

Commands run without a shell. Replace every path with an absolute path on the host.

## Read unread mail over IMAP

```sh
bun bin/desk-imap.ts --host imap.example.org --user sam@example.org --account personal
```

Set `DESK_IMAP_PASSWORD` in the adapter's environment before running the command. `--password-env <name>` selects another variable. Passwords never go in argv. A Cortex service needs the variable in its own environment.

`desk-imap` opens INBOX read-only and prints at most 30 unread messages, newest UID first. It fetches envelopes and up to 16 KiB of the first plain-text body part without marking mail read. Messages without a sender or Message-ID are omitted. HTML-only messages have no `firstParagraph`. Body download failures leave the envelope visible without a paragraph.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | required | IMAP host |
| `--user` | required | Login name |
| `--port` | `993` | Port, from 1 to 65535 |
| `--starttls` | off | Require STARTTLS instead of immediate TLS. Set `--port 143` when appropriate. |
| `--mailbox` | `INBOX` | Mailbox to read |
| `--account` | `mail` | Label carried on each item |
| `--limit` | `30` | Maximum messages, from 1 to 200 |
| `--password-env` | `DESK_IMAP_PASSWORD` | Password environment variable |

The account label identifies this source. It does not configure the personal `email` CLI or its trash and draft writers. Configure compatible action commands separately before enabling mail writes.

## Push through ntfy

Subscribe to a topic in your ntfy client, then configure the command transport:

```yaml
mc:
  desk:
    interruptions:
      transport: command
      command: [/absolute/path/to/bun, /absolute/path/to/cortex-desk-adapters/bin/desk-ntfy.ts, --server, https://ntfy.example.org, --topic, your-private-topic]
      timeoutSeconds: 15
```

`desk-ntfy --topic <topic> [--server https://ntfy.sh] [--token-env NTFY_TOKEN]` reads one JSON push from stdin. Required fields are `key`, `title`, and `why`. An optional `action` has `label` and an HTTP or HTTPS `url`. The title becomes the notification title, `why` its body, and the URL its click destination. Other URL schemes are omitted.

The command posts once over HTTPS and exits 0 on a successful HTTP answer. It exits 1 with a reason on stderr on malformed input, an HTTP failure, or an eight-second request timeout. It does not retry. If the named environment variable contains a token, it sends a bearer token. Use a server and topic whose access rules suit the information in your notifications. A public topic name is not a password.

Test the command with an example push:

```sh
printf '%s' '{"key":"example:1","title":"Try the Desk","why":"This is an example push."}' | bun bin/desk-ntfy.ts --server https://ntfy.example.org --topic your-private-topic
```
